# Welcome to my GitHub page

## About me: 
Half of my working time is dedicated to the realization of a PhD thesis in cognitive psychology at the Neuropsycholinguistic lab (Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Geneva). My thesis aims at understanding how interference in language production affects behavior as well as brain functioning. 
The other half of my working time, I work as research assistant in the EEG and Epilepsy unit at the University Hospital in Geneva (Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva). The focus of my work at this position is the quantification of the predictive values of paraclinical exams for the diagnosis of first epileptic seizures.


## Current projects : 

* Dynamic of language production over the lifespan 
* Creation of a normative database for the verbal fluency test
* ERP decomposition of the Stroop effect over the lifespan : qualitative and qualtitative modulations
* ERP dynamic of a Hayling task
* First epileptic seizure : an epidemiologic and statistical modelling of the problematic
* Brain connectivity changes in surgical treatment of epilepsy : neuropsychological implications 
* Learning to trust a face: the time course of brain activation during a money game
