## Welcome to my GitHub page test

Half of my working time is dedicated to the realization of a PhD thesis in cognitive psychology at the Neuropsycholinguistic lab (Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Geneva). My thesis aims at understanding how interference in language production affects behavior as well as brain functioning. 
The other half of my working time, I work as research assistant in the EEG and Epilepsy unit at the University Hospital in Geneva (Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva). The focus of my work at this position is the quantification of the predictive values of paraclinical exams for the diagnosis of first epileptic seizures.
